        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Kattappa is a main character in the Baahubali franchise. 
            He is a member of a lineage of warriors who serve the royals of Mahishmati with a status 
            equivalent to a slave, but he is the commander and general of Mahishmati's army. 
            He is a skilled and strong combatant and mentor to the princes and heirs of the kingdom.
            Kattappa helped train Amarendra Baahubali and was close to him as Amarendra grew up.
            When Sakithan betrayed Mahishmati and sold its war secrets to the Kalakeyas, 
            Kattappa helped Amarendra and Bhallaladeva catch Sakithan. During the Mahishmati-Kalakeya 
            Battle, Kattappa led the center v-shape formation against the Kalakeyas.
            After Amarendra was declared king, Kattappa went with him on a tour of the kingdom of 
            Mahishmati, where Amarendra met Devasena. Amarendra acted as a simpleton, with Kattappa 
            as his uncle, to become closer to Devasena. Kattappa and Amarendra journeyed to Kunthala. 
            While in Kunthala, Kattappa misinterprets a marriage proposal sent to Devasena by Sivagami 
            to be for Amarendra when, in fact, it is for Bhallaladeva. Kattappa and Amarendra help 
            Kunthala defeat the Pindaris, but he has to accompany Amarendra and Devasena back to 
            Mahishmati after Devasena's rude reply to Bhallaladeva's marriage proposal.
            Kattappa was powerless to prevent Bhallaladeva's ascension to the throne, 
            as well as Bhallaladeva's attempts to lower Amarendra's rank. At Amarendra and 
            Devasena's baby shower, they make Kattappa the godfather of their baby (Mahendra).
            After Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva manipulated Sivagami into thinking Amarendra had 
            Kumara Varma try to kill Bhallaladeva, Sivagami makes Kattappa kill Amarendra. 
            He reluctantly feigns being in danger, and stabs Amarendra in the back as Amarendra fights 
            the Kalakeyas (led by Inkoshi's brother).After killing Amarendra, Kattappa confronts 
            Sivagami, who finally realizes how she has been manipulated by Bhallaladeva and Bijjaladeva. 
            Kattappa helps Sivagami escape with Mahendra.
            For the next 25 years, Kattappa resents Bhallaladeva, but remains his loyal slave.
