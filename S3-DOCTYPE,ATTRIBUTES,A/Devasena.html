        <p>Princess Devasena is the younger sister of Jaya Varma and member of the Kunthala royals.
            On top of the waterfall, Shivdu discovers that the mask belongs to Avanthika, a rebellious warrior 
            whose group has indulged in guerrilla warfare against King Bhallaladeva. 
            The group is led by Jaya Varma, who has intended to rescue a captive and tormented Devasena 
            for nearly 25 years.Shivdu shows his face and rescues the queen, unaware that she is his mother. 
            Shivdu and Devasena are chased down by Prince Bhadra, Bhalla Deva's only son and Kattappa, 
            who is a skilled fighter and a slave. When Shivdu beheads Bhadra, Sanga and her tribe, 
            Avanthika and her group and the Mahishmati's army comes there. Kattappa realises that 
            Shivdu is Mahendra Baahubali, the son of late King Amarendra Baahubali and Devasena. 
            Kattappa begins to narrate the story from 25 years ago.
