        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A woman emerges from a cave underneath a mountain, carrying an infant. 
        While trying to cross a raging river, she is swept away by the current. Facing imminent death, 
        she holds the baby aloft and prays to Lord Shiva to spare the baby, Mahendra Baahubali, for the sake of Mahishmati Kingdom. 
        The child is saved by the people of Amburi tribe, and their chieftain's wife Sanga adopts him, naming him Siva.
        Siva grows up to be an ambitious and mischievous child, obsessed with ascending the mountain despite his mother's pleas, 
        but fails every time. As a young man, he shows superhuman strength 
        while lifting a lingam of Lord Shiva and placing it at the foot of the mountain. 
        As he does so, a mask falls from above. Realising it belongs to a woman, Siva is determined to find its owner, and finally succeeds in climbing the mountain. Upon reaching the top, he encounters Avantika, to whom the mask belongs, and follows her. He learns that she is a member of a resistance group dedicated to overthrowing the tyrannical King Bhallaladeva of Mahishmati, and rescuing the captive princess Devasena.</p>
