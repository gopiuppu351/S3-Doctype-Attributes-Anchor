        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sivagami raises her birth son Bhallaladeva and her nephew Amarendra Baahubali, 
        whom she takes into her care after the death of his mother, and teaches them academics, philosophy, and warefare. 
        In the TV series Baahubali: The Lost Legends the two brothers explore their surrounding regions and fight to defend their kingdom from the forces of evil.
        Presumably because of the confrontations in The Lost Legends, The viscous Kalakeya tribe is at war with Mahishmati 
        and are received by a traitor stating the time to lay siege to the kingdom. 
        Chief Inkoshi of the Kalakeya insults her, claiming that he'll impregnate her and birth heirs once he takes the kingdom. 
        This infuriates both her and Amarendra Baahubali who intend to make him pay. 
        Baahubali strategically overcomes the Kalakeya's offense and takes Inkoshi hostage, and despite being ordered to make him suffer, Bhalla slays him on the spot. 
        Sivagami, recognizing Amarendra's kindness in protecting the citizens decides to crown Baahubali the next king of Mahishmati.</p>
