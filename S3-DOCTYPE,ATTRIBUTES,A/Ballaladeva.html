        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bhallaladeva killed his enemy king Inkoshi of the Kalakeyas; tried to kill Mahendra Baahubali; imprisoned Devasena for 25 years and was involved in the murder of Amarendra Baahubali and Sivagami.
            In the battle against Kalkeyas, he killed thousands of soldiers, the main war elephant with a single shot on its armored forehead, on which the king Inkoshi of Kalakeyas battles, 
            the king Inkoshi of Kalakeyas (already wounded by Amarendra Baahubali), and even a few of his kingdom's own innocent subjects imprisoned by Kalkeyas.
            Defeats and kills a raging and charging giant muscular Indian gaur with bare hands.
            He catches a fast-moving arrow shot at him from behind by Mahendra Baahubali, using his right hand.
            He had tried to kill Baahubali many times even before the Kalkeya War and risking his kingdom by it as well.
            He destroyed the whole Kuntaladesha only due to his anger on Devasena.
            A 90 metre tall gold statue of Bhallaladeva was built after completion of his 25 years as the king which was later destroyed during his battle with Mahendra Bahubali. Later its broken head was dumped in the river.
            He used a scythed chariot drawn by a pair of horses in the Kalakeya War. It was destroyed by the Kalakeya chief. In his battle with Mahendra Baahubali he had a much more powerful chariot drawn by two Gaur bisons with three spinning scythes and a mechanism to shoot multiple arrows simultaneously at small intervals. It was destroyed by Mahendra.
            He carries a unique mace (Gada) whose head be detached to be elongated through a chain inside it and looks same as that of Ball and chain. Mahendra smashed it while fighting Bhallaladeva.
